                      The discovery of a set of what look like ancient hominin
                      footprints on the island of Crete could throw our
                      understanding of human evolution into disarray. Received
                      wisdom is that after from the chimp lineage, our hominin
                      ancestors were confined to Africa until around 1.5 million
                      years ago. The prints found in Crete, however, to a
                      creature that appears to have lived 5.7 million years ago
                      â€” suggesting a more complex story. More research is needed
                      to confirm what kind of animal made them. However, the
                      prints seem to have been by a creature that walked
                      upright, on the soles of clawless feet (rather than on its
                      toes), with a big toe positioned like our own, rather than
                      sticking out sideways like an ape's. It may yet turn out
                      to have been a unknown non-hominin that had evolved with a
                      human-like foot; but the explanatory paper, in the
                      Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, is not the
                      first to suggest that hominins could have originated in
                      Europe. A few months ago, a team put forward evidence,
                      gleaned from fossils found in Greece and Bulgaria that a
                      7.2 million-year old ape known as Graecopithecus was in
                      fact a hominin.

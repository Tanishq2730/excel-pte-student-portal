          This is an opportunity to check that your headset is working
          correctly.
          <br />
          1. Put your headset on and adjust it so that it fits comfortably over
          your ears.
          <br />
          2. When you are ready, click on the â–º button. You will hear a short
          recording.
          <br />
          3. If you do not hear anything in your headphones while the status
          reads "Playing", please contact the system administrator.
